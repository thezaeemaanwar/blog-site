      "La Matatena is the Spanish word for the game of Jacks, echoing Mateo‚Äôs nostalgia for the pizza of his youth. The restaurant is in a gorgeous old mansion with detailed blue and grey tiles and an intricate wooden wall frame that gives the place an intimate feel.  With a second seating area in a loft area above the bar, the space never feels crowded even when it‚Äôs full.",

      "Iceland was magical. With only a few days in the country, I was limited in time but what I did see completely bowled me over. Autumn turned the landscape into a carpet of ochres and reds and patches of mossy green; the weather was so unpredictable that I kept having to remind myself I was in the same country from one minute to the next. Driving the Golden Circle (to Gullfoss, Thingvellir and Geysir) in a day brought some unexpected weather karma too ‚Äì buckets of sideways sleet and rain would accompany the drive from one place to another, with the sun bursting through the moment the car stopped and it was time to get out.",

    content:
      "Spending time in Morocco is a study in contrasts, a confluence of old and new lives jumbled together, straining to move toward modernity while sustaining ancient traditions. The streets of villages around the Sahara, full of colourful jalabas and babies swaddled to the backs of their mothers as they go about their days, seems a world away from the luxury apartments of the bigger cities. And there‚Äôs no better place to see the confluence of those many worlds than in Marrakech.",

      "Years after I wrote about an impromptu life discussion on the Q train, I find myself back in New York every summer, comparing the city that was against the ‚Äúme‚Äù that is, trying to fit in meetings and time with friends I love, wandering around and under the bridges and into the leafy green parts of a concrete city. The summer visits are a pleasure but never feel like enough time. I know the city so well but it is remains in a state of permanent flux, shapeshifting into something new during my absence. I usually leave my camera in my bag and roam the streets with an iPhone and a roving head. With cousins living in town and friends from university happily settled in Brooklyn, I always feel extremely grateful to get these weeks of fierce, strengthening hugs, of playtime in the park, of writing and reading on long subway rides. And, of course, impromptu conversations with strangers.",
